## Usage

### Run the application

You can run the application locally, self-contained by using the provided container image definition and compose file that is included in the repo root directory.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

> **NOTE** The included compose file loads two container images, the built project image and a supporting mongo database.

> **NOTE** Initial run of the compose file will build the container and the project. If you wish to rebuild the project you will have to execute a `docker-compose build` command.

### Local development run

```bash
# Reservation development
dotnet run --project ./src/Scheduling.Reservation.API/Scheduling.Reservation.API.csproj
```

```bash
# Availability development
dotnet run --project ./src/Scheduling.Availability.API/Scheduling.Availability.API.csproj
```

### Testing

```bash
# unit tests
dotnet test -c Release --verbosity normal --filter "Category!=LongRunning"
```
